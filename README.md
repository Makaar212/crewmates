# Web Development Project 7 - *Crewmate Creator*

Submitted by: **Your Name Here**

This web app: **lets users build their own Among Us crew. Users can create crewmates by giving them a name, a role, and a color, see their whole crew in a gallery sorted newest first, open a detail page for each crewmate, and update or delete them. All data is stored in Supabase.**

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

  - Users can name the crewmate
  - Users can set the crewmate’s attributes by clicking on one of several values
- [x] **The web app includes a summary page of all the user’s added crewmatese**
  -  The web app contains a summary page dedicated to displaying all the crewmates the user has made so far
  -  The summary page is sorted by creation date such that the most recently created crewmates appear at the top
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be updated from the list of crewmates in the summary page**
  - Each crewmate has an edit button that will take users to an update form for the relevant crewmate
  - Users can see the current attributes of their crewmate on the update form
  - After editing the crewmate's attribute values using the form, the user can immediately see those changes reflected in the update form and on the summary page 
- [x] **A previously created crewmate can be deleted from the crewmate list**
  - Using the edit form detailed in the previous _crewmates can be updated_ feature, there is a button that allows users to delete that crewmate
  - After deleting a crewmate, the crewmate should no longer be visible in the summary page
- [x] **Each crewmate has a direct, unique URL link to an info page about them**
  - Clicking on a crewmate in the summary page navigates to a detail page for that crewmate
  - The detail page contains extra information about the crewmate not included in the summary page
  - Users can navigate to to the edit form from the detail page

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] A crewmate can be given a category upon creation which restricts their attribute value options
  - e.g., a Dungeons and Dragons class or a development team role (project manager, product owner, etc.)
  - User can choose a `category` option to describe their crewmate before any attributes are specified
  - Based on the category value, users are allowed to access only a subset of the possible attributes
- [ ] A section of the summary page, displays summary statistics about a user’s crew on their crew page
  - e.g., the percent of members with a certain attribute 
- [ ] The summary page displays a custom “success” metric about a user’s crew which changes the look of the crewmate list
  - e.g., a pirate crew’s predicted success at commandeering a new galley


The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Each crewmate card and detail page is accented with that crewmate's in-game color
* [x] The whole crewmate card is clickable, with a separate edit button
* [x] The edit page shows a "Current Info" box that updates as soon as changes are saved
* [x] Users are asked to confirm before a crewmate is deleted
* [x] The detail page shows a description of the crewmate's role and the date they joined the crew

## Notes

* The secret Supabase key is kept out of the frontend. The app only uses the publishable key, with row-level security policies on the `crewmates` table.
* A link can't be nested inside another link, so the crewmate card's name link is stretched over the whole card with CSS, keeping the edit button clickable on its own.
